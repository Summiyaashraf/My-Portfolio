          A passionate web developer with a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript. I love turning ideas into functional projects, using my skills to build websites and applications. I've also gained experience working with design tools like Figma to create visually appealing layouts.
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed mb-4">
          I have completed my CIT (Certificate in Information Technology) and have intended to gain hands-on experience in the tech industry. Currently, I am pursuing an advanced IT course at Governor House to further enhance my knowledge. Alongside my studies, I work as a teacher, sharing my knowledge and passion for technology with my students.
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed mb-4">
          With a deep interest in both education and technology, I'm always eager to explore new tools and techniques that enhance user experiences. Balancing my role as a teacher and developer allows me to apply my technical knowledge in a real-world scenario.
